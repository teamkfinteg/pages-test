description: |
    The IISWithBindings AnyAgent allows a user to create, configure, and manage a Keyfactor certificate store defined as an Internet Information Systems (IIS) binding definition. The certificate itself will still be stored in the defined serverâ€™s personal certificate store, but the management within Keyfactor will be abstracted to appear as if the binding itself houses the certificate.
