# Overview

At Keyfactor we recognize that your enterprise architecture may be as unique as your business.  While there may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for every organization, we have designed our platform with extension points that enable it to adapt with your enterprise. 

We have provided a number of integration examples to help get started and to demonstrate the power of Keyfactor Integrations.  Our goal is to help you benefit from the security, efficiency and peace of mind that Keyfactor provides without the need to compromise the infrastructure design that works for you.

Our publicly available integrations have their source code open to you on [our GitHub](https://github.com/Keyfactor). Those integrations and code snippets found in this SDK are available for use and modification under the [Apache License 2.0](https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Scenarios

- Are you considering Keyfactor but use a non Microsoft Certificate Authority?
- Are you a current Keyfactor customer and need to adapt your enterprise environment?
- Do you need to publish certificate events to your enterprise events hub?
- Do you need to manage certificates on your fleet of IoT devices?

With the Keyfactor Integrations SDK you can respond to platform or orchestrator events, interact with external services, translate non-microsoft certificate formats, and perform entirely custom actions in response to Keyfactor events.

## Getting Started

This document is intended to provide you with an understanding of the capabilities of Keyfactor Integrations and to help you to get started creating your own.

First we will walk through environment setup, and then discuss each extension point in detail with examples and instructions on how to get it running in your environment.
